    <h1>PREPARATION </h1>
  <p> Did you know that you can make veggie noodles out of cucumber, carrots, kohlrabi, and more? We’ve all heard of zucchini noodles by now, but lots of other vegetables can transform into curly, colorful noodles too! Making these veggie noodles is one of my favorite summer cooking projects. It doesn’t require the stove or the oven, so unlike baking, it won’t heat up the whole house. It’s also a great way to showcase peak-season summer produce. But most importantly, it’s fun! There’s something mesmerizing about watching a humble root veggie turn into vibrant vegetable noodles.</p>
<p>You can make vegetables noodles with a regular vegetable peeler, julienne peeler, or mandoline slicer, but my favorite way to do it is with a spiralizer. I’ve worked with two types of spiralizers – countertop spiralizers and the KitchenAid Spiralizer Attachment. Of the countertop spiralizers I’ve owned, the Inspiralizer (pictured below) has been my favorite. It clamps to the counter, so it doesn’t move around while you work. It’s also easy to clean and relatively small, so it’s not hard to find a place to store it.</p>
<h2> Enjoy! </h2>
