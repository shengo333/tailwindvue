A quick and easy Tofu Curry with a delicious tomato-onion sauce that comes together in a blender. Creamy and perfectly spiced. Serve with rice or naan and take the rest of the day off from cooking! This is a vegan, gluten-free recipe and it can be soy-free and nut-free.

It takes all of five, maybe 10 minutes, to put together the sauce for this easy tofu curry, but it has so much flavor, you could pretend you've been slogging at the stove all day and let them do the dishes. ðŸ˜‰

Not that there are that many dishes, or pots, to clean. This is essentially a one-pot curry (you need the blender too, of course). All you need to do to make it is toss ingredients into the blender, pour the sauce into a hot pan, cook it down, add the tofu, and you're done.

It's quite foolproof.
The resulting sauce has rich, buttery notes like a makhani, and you'll be getting compliments like crazy.

How to make this tofu curry:
There's not much to give you by way of instructions, because all you need to do is chop the ingredients roughly, then toss them into the blender. Tomatoes, onions, ginger, garlic, a few spices like coriander powder, paprika and/or cayenne, and garam masala, a handful of cashew nuts and a bit of kasoori methi all go in, get blitzed into smoothness, then poured into a hot pan with a little oil.
The only time you'll need to exercise some patience is when your sauce is cooking down. You need to do this because the ingredients were all raw when you added them to the blender, remember? Now you need to let them cook down and lose almost all of that moisture, so the flavors you get are rich and deep. For this, make sure you cook the paste to the point where it's quite sticky looking, and has a shimmer, indicating the oil is separating.
I like using baked tofu in this recipe just because it adds that chewy texture to the curry, but you can simply use cubed super firm tofu and it'll be quite delicious too--softer and creamier.
Add water or vegetable stock for the sauce, vegetable stock is preferable, because it builds more depth.
Garnish with cilantro. </p>
